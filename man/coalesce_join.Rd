\usage{
coalesce_join(
  x,
  y,
  by = NULL,
  keep = c("left", "right"),
  suffix = c(".x", ".y"),
  join = c("full_join", "left_join", "right_join", "inner_join")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame (left table in the join).}

\item{y}{A data frame (right table in the join).}

\item{by}{A character vector of variables to join by. If NULL, will use all
common variables. See \code{?dplyr::join} for details.}

\item{keep}{Character string specifying which table's values to keep when
both tables have non-NA values for overlapping columns. Options are
"left" (default) to keep values from x, or "right" to keep values from y.}

\item{suffix}{Character vector of length 2 specifying suffixes to use for
overlapping column names. Default is c(".x", ".y").}

\item{join}{Character string specifying the type of join to perform. Options
are "full_join" (default), "left_join", "right_join", or "inner_join".}
}
\value{
A data frame resulting from the specified join operation with
overlapping columns coalesced according to the \code{keep} parameter. Temporary
suffix columns are removed from the output.
}
\description{
Perform a join operation and coalesce overlapping columns, keeping values
from either the left or right table based on preference.
}
\details{
This function extends standard dplyr join operations by automatically
coalescing overlapping columns based on the \code{keep} argument. When both
tables contain non-NA values for the same column, the value from the
specified table (left or right) will be retained.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
df1 <- data.frame(id = 1:3, name = c("A", NA, "C"))
df2 <- data.frame(id = 2:4, name = c("B", "C", "D"))

# Keep left values when both exist
coalesce_join(df1, df2, by = "id", keep = "left")

# Keep right values when both exist
coalesce_join(df1, df2, by = "id", keep = "right", join = "left_join")
}
