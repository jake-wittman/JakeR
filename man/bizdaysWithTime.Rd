\title{Calculate Business Days with Decimal Time}
\usage{
bizdaysWithTime(start_dt, end_dt, cal)
}
\arguments{
\item{start_dt}{A POSIXct, POSIXlt, Date object, or vector of such objects
representing the start datetime(s). If a Date object is provided, time is
assumed to be 00:00:00.}

\item{end_dt}{A POSIXct, POSIXlt, Date object, or vector of such objects
representing the end datetime(s). Must be the same length as \code{start_dt}.
If a Date object is provided, time is assumed to be 00:00:00.}

\item{cal}{Character string specifying the name of the business calendar
to use. Must be a calendar previously created with
\code{\link[bizdays]{create.calendar}}. Default is "my_calendar".}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as \code{start_dt} and
\code{end_dt}, representing the number of business days between each pair
of datetimes, including fractional days based on the time component.
Returns 0 for any pair where the time span contains no business days.
}
\description{
Calculates the number of business days between two datetime stamps,
accounting for weekends and holidays while treating each business day
as a full 24-hour period. Returns a decimal value representing partial days.
This function is vectorized and can handle multiple date pairs simultaneously.
}
\details{
This function calculates business days while respecting the time component
of datetime stamps. It treats each business day as a full 24-hour period,
so time differences are preserved proportionally across business days only.

The calculation for each pair:
\enumerate{
\item Determines the number of full business days between the start and end dates
\item Calculates the total elapsed time in days (including time component)
\item Computes the ratio of business days to calendar days
\item Applies this ratio to the elapsed time to get business days with decimals
}

Weekends and holidays (as defined in the specified calendar) are excluded
from the calculation. If the entire period falls on non-business days,
the function returns 0 for that pair.
