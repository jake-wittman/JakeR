\title{Send Windows notification message}
\usage{
notifyWindows(message = "R code has finished running!")
}
\arguments{
\item{message}{Character string. The message to display in the notification.
Default is "R code has finished running!".}
}
\value{
Invisible NULL. The function is called for its side effect of
displaying a notification and printing a status message to the console.
}
\description{
Sends a notification message using Windows' built-in \code{msg} command.
This function displays a pop-up message to all users on the local machine.
Useful for alerting when long-running R code has completed.
}
\details{
This function uses the Windows \code{msg} command to send notifications. The \code{msg}
command may not be available on all Windows systems (particularly Home editions)
or may be disabled for security reasons. If the command fails, a message is
printed to the console instead.

The notification is sent asynchronously (wait = FALSE), so the function
returns immediately without waiting for the notification to be dismissed.
}
\note{
This function only works on Windows systems where the \code{msg} command is
available and enabled. On other operating systems or if the command fails,
only a console message will be displayed.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Basic usage with default message
notifyWindows()

# Custom notification message
notifyWindows("Data analysis completed successfully!")

# Use at the end of long-running processes
long_analysis <- function() {
  # Your analysis code here...
  Sys.sleep(5)  # Simulate long process
  notifyWindows("Analysis finished!")
}
long_analysis()

# Notify about specific results
notifyWindows("Model training complete - Accuracy: 94.2\%")
}
